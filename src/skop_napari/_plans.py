"""Choosing how an array gets fitted to the op that is about to receive it.

An op says how many axes it consumes and what it likes to call them; skop turns
that plus "this array is `z y x`" into one `AdaptationPlan`, best effort, and
lets it be edited ([skop design
0006](https://github.com/apposed/scikit-ops/blob/main/docs/design/0006-axis-mapping.md)).
This is the editing: one row per adaptable image input, with the resolved axes
on top, a mapping combo per slot the op consumes, and a disposition combo per
axis left over.

The rule the layout encodes is that skop no longer forbids anything. The
default plan never discards data, a misaligned mapping is shown as a warning
rather than a blocked run, and the only thing that disables Run is an array
that cannot be adapted at all.
