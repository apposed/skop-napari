"""Working out what a layer's axes actually are.

skop refuses to guess this ([skop design
0005](https://github.com/apposed/scikit-ops/blob/main/docs/design/0005-dimensional-adaptation.md)),
and it is right to: guessing needs a viewer to guess *for*. This module is
that guess, and it is the whole reason skop-napari can hand a `(z, y, x)`
stack to a strictly 2-D op.

The rungs run from "someone said so" to "the layer labels its own axes", and
they stop there. An axis nobody has named stays unnamed: napari shows it as
`-3`, `-2`, `-1`, and so do we. Inventing a name would be a claim about the
data that nothing in the data supports, and it is not needed -- an op that
iterates over an unknown axis does the same thing whatever that axis turns out
to be, and skop matches optional slots by name only, so an unnamed axis can
never be silently consumed as something it is not.

What the viewer is displaying is a different kind of thing, and it lives here
too: it says nothing about what an axis is *called*, but it says exactly which
axes the user is looking at, which is what should land in the op's spatial
slots. `displayed` reports that, in both 2-D and 3-D view, and `_plans` turns
it into an initial mapping -- names or no names.

Each answer carries where it came from and whether it was declared or
inferred, because the panel shows both: a user who disagrees types over it,
and what they type is written back onto the layer, so the disagreement is had
once rather than every run.
