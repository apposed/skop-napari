"""Rendering a workflow: a combo box per stage, with that stage's own inputs.

A workflow is an op whose parameters include *other ops*. Two of its
parameters go together -- a ``Choices`` chooser naming what may be run, and
the ``ParamsFor`` dict holding the chosen op's settings -- so they are drawn
as one thing: a combo box with the chosen op's widgets underneath it,
rebuilt whenever the combo changes.

Which is nearly free, because the widgets under a chooser are built by the
same ``build_inputs`` that builds the panel's own. An op is an op; a workflow
stage is drawn exactly like a top-level op, one level in.

The parameters a workflow supplies itself are not drawn. The workflow says
which those are through ``ParamsFor(..., binds=...)`` -- both stages of
detect_then_mask take the image, and asking for it twice would be the panel
misrepresenting what is about to happen.
