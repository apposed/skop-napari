"""Turning an OpSpec into magicgui input widgets.

Nothing here imports napari. The two napari-shaped things a caller must supply
are ``annotation_for``, which says what type each parameter should be rendered
as, and ``value_for``, which converts what the resulting widget holds into
what the op asked for. ``_roles`` has the napari answers, and a different
front end would pass different ones. If skop ever grows a second magicgui
host, this module is what moves.

Widgets are built one parameter at a time rather than by handing magicgui a
whole synthesized function, because ops in the wild contain parameters
magicgui cannot render -- ``tuple[int, ...]`` among them -- and one of those
must not take the entire panel down with it.
