"""The Ops panel: pick an op, fill in its inputs, run it.

One widget for the whole collection, rather than one contribution per op.
npe2 wants a static manifest, and skop discovers its ops by importing them,
so a per-op contribution would mean generating the manifest at build time and
losing the ability to drop a new op into the collection and see it appear.
The napari team is working on dynamic registration; when it lands, this file
is what gets split up.
