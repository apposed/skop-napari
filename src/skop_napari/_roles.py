"""Translating skop's roles into napari's vocabulary.

This is the whole of what makes skop-napari napari-specific: two lookup
tables and one shape adapter. Everything else in this package is about
widgets and threads.

skop deliberately refuses to guess -- an unannotated array reports no role at
all -- so the guessing happens here, where there is a viewer to guess for.

The adapters exist because a role names what an array *means*, not how napari
wants it laid out. skop states bounding boxes as ``(N, 4)`` rows of
``[min_y, min_x, max_y, max_x]``; napari reads that same array as a single
shape with N vertices in four dimensions. Reconciling the two is this
package's job, not skop's -- skop.types imports no GUI, and the layout napari
wants is not more correct, only more napari.

Both directions need it, which is easy to forget: ``layer_args_for`` adapts an
op's output on the way to a layer, and ``value_for`` adapts a layer's data on
the way into an op. A mask detector taking boxes from a Shapes layer is the
case that needs both.
